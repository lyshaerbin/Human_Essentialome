# Human_Essentialome
The essential coding and noncoding genes in human
All the datasets, codes and results for the human essentialome project. 


An increasing number of essential genes and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been identified, however, there is still a lack of knowledge about the functional consequences of human gene essentiality. Here, we systematically analyzed the human essentialome from a network perspective. We found that essential coding genes and ncRNAs are mostly context-specific. Moreover, genes in the human coding and noncoding essentialome are enriched for cancer mutations with high functional impact and disease risks. Our network analyses also suggest that protein interactome topology and neighborhood community integrated with gene expression profiles, are highly predictive of gene essentiality. Thus, we proposed NET-PET (Network-based Priorization of Essentiality Tool) to systematically identify the essentialome, which is further independently validated by functional screens in 33 cell lines. Comparative analyses suggest that human coding and non-coding essentialome converge to the cell cycle pathway and multiple essential genes and ncRNAs are associated with survival in cancer. Our study provides a holistic insight into molecular determinants for cell fate and implicates potential biomarkers for cancer precision medicine.
